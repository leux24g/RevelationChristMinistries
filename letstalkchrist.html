                                            Now, LET'S TALK CHRIST; specifically, let us indulge in the very important subject of Christ as our Peace. Two Texts from Scripture serve to provide the starting reference for what the Spirit is saying here:<br>

                                            Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)  
                                            For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.<br>

                                            And,<br>

                                            John 14:27 (KJV)  <br>
                                            Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>

                                            We are living in a very disturbed world plagued presently with wars, rumors of wars, and marked divisions. These trials are seen in nearly every continent and are so significant in some cases, even threatening world wars like in Europe with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or in the case of China's threat to invade Taiwan. Here in Kenya where our ministry is based, a very polarising election has concluded in deep disagreements and accusations, and again there are those that fear that dissatisfied losers will fight it out, if not in court, in the streets.<br>
                                            The world desperately needs peace. And it appears that even the very ideals and institutions that many have embraced and believed in to ensure peace are in fact, sponsoring wars and divisions.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Democracy is such an ideal ocassioning marked strife in the United States of America where it's reputedly to have been best practiced. There we see a country irreparably divided following their last presidential elections in 2020. Kenya is not alone in this; in Africa, it is joined by nearly every other country after an election season. 
                                            Consequently, many are despairing for peace. Many are calling for calm and hoping for agreeable resolutions in the face of the marked divides. 
                                            <br>
                                            Reality is that God is indeed shaking the Heavens and the Earth, and He is bringing men around the world to reckon His Son as the only Guarantor for PEACE. Where men have trusted in their ideals and institutions, their own means of realising peace, God is shaking them up to bring them to reckon Christ Jesus as their PEACE. 
                                            <br>
                                            Beloveds, it is essential that you wake up to Christ Jesus as your PEACE. Democracy cannot guarantee peace, elections cannot guarantee peace, the governments of men cannot guarantee peace, not even the wishes of men can guarantee peace; the only Way, the only Truth, the only Life, that guarantees PEACE is that of Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace.
                                            Indeed, when the Prophet Isaiah heralded His Birth, He was prospecting with joy the birth of the only guarantee of Peace on Earth, the Prince of Peace.
                                            <br>
                                            Saints of God, Christ Jesus is our Peace; and not just for the world but even for you personally. In a world plagued by strife, by disagreements, hatred, wars, anger, even fear, you can rise above all that and have peace, peace that surpasses understanding (Philippians 4:7). And not only that, you can be so peaceful, so filled with peace that you become an ambassador of peace, God's Ambassador sharing His Peace in this world riddled with troubles (2 Corinthians 5:19, 20).
                                            <br>
                                            This is partly the reason why Apostle Sarah and I are sharing LET'S TALK CHRIST with you, why as a daily devotional that will feature on our website- @www.apostlejosephandsarah.co.ke- we will communicate daily with you, that you should know Christ, the Prince of Peace, and walk in His Peace, even grow in His Word to become His Ambassador of Peace. It is our deepest desire that you will join us in bearing the gospel of peace in this world plagued by wars:
                                            <br>
                                            Romans 10:15 (KJV)  <br>
                                            And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
                                            <br>
                                            Let us PRAY:
                                            <br>
                                            Father God,
                                            <br>
                                            You are our God, the Great I Am<br>
                                            to Whom we look for everything.<br>
                                            We receive Christ Jesus as our Peace.<br>
                                            Help us embrace Him and be anchored in His Power that we should have His Peace.<br>
                                            Thank You for doing so in Jesus' Name.<br>
                                            AMEN and AMEN!!!<br><br>

                                            SHALOM!<br>

                                            Your Servant in the Grace of Christ Jesus<br><br>

                                            Now, let’s talk Christ; today, as we wind up on this very serious subject on Peace that has occupied us this week, let us indulge on how this Heavenly Peace is indeed distinguished from worldly peace, and how indeed it will perfect this corrupt world. Two Holy Texts serve to guide our sharing:
                                            <br>
                                            Matthew 5:43-48-  <br>
                                            Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy <br>
                                            neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love <br>
                                            your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them  <br>
                                            that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, <br>
                                            and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father <br>
                                            which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil <br>
                                            and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the <br>
                                            unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have <br>
                                            ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your <br>
                                            brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the <br>
                                            publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father <br>
                                            which is in heaven is perfect. <br><br>

                                            And,<br>
                                            2Corinthians 5:16-20 <br> 
                                            Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: <br>
                                            yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet <br>
                                            now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any <br>
                                            man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are <br>
                                            passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all <br>
                                            things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by <br>
                                            Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; <br>
                                            To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto <br>
                                            himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath <br>
                                            committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we <br>
                                            are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you <br>
                                            by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. <br><br>

                                            This is quite a serious subject and God knows that we couldn’t exhaust in just one week. Apostle Sarah and I have labored in love to share as much to inspire your interest in it as the Holy Spirit could afford us. We encourage you to pray more on it; seek that God should furnish you with even more knowledge on the subject because the world is in a most difficult time as men grow increasingly selfish, malicious, and contentious. We need peace; and we need it now, and not just any peace but rather the peace of Christ, Heavenly Peace.
                                            Accompanying this sharing here in our Let’s Talk Christ Daily Devotional, I am also working on a book that will share even more comprehensively on the subject. We really want you to embrace the Peace of Christ, to rise above the strife of this world, to be in Peace. It is why we have each of our presentations accompanied with brief video sharings on the subject, and are working on entire teaching series on Peace that should serve to give you even more knowledge on it. We really desire that you not only walk in peace but really become an ambassador of peace.
                                            <br>
                                            It is important that you realize that there is indeed a specific peace that we are sharing on here; not the peace of the world which is so often a lie, vain, and quite hypocritical, and conditioned on so many factors. The peace we are speaking of is Christ’s Peace, Heavenly Peace; He Himself distinguished it from the one of the world:
                                            <br>
                                            John 14:27-  
                                            Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as 
                                            the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be 
                                            troubled, neither let it be afraid. 

                                            This peace is a spiritual peace, a Heavenly Peace, the only peace that can truly work to ensure Peace on Earth. It is a peace founded on love, on the finished Work of the Cross and the Power of the Blood; wherein, Christ put to death the flesh and all its divisions and strifes, and made all of us one new man, reconciled together with God. I am talking of a peace that has no room for prejudice; a peace that reckons all men to be the image and likeness of God, that doesn’t consider men according to tribes, nations, and such differences.
                                            The Apostle Paul taught such a peace citing:

                                            Galatians 3:26-28-
                                            For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
                                            For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have 
                                            put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is 
                                            neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: 
                                            for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 

                                            He knew what we all desperately need to know today; that before God, we are all His Children, that He doesn’t reckon these divisions that we hold dear like our tribes, races, color, even gender, that He sees as one, having communion with Him.

                                            Once you understand that then forgiving others becomes easier; we forgive them because they are really worthy of mercy having been made Children of God. Can you imagine holding onto a grudge against a Child of God? Isn’t it tantamount to being offended with God Himself? Would that be a wise thing to entertain, God against you?
                                            Christ Jesus would have us love one another, reckon each other in the same measure that we acknowledge Him to be the Child of God, and then live that way in Heavenly Peace. Apostle Sarah and I believe that this is the ultimate goal of the Heavenly Commission of Christ, the reason why He insisted that the Gospel of Peace shall be preached to the ends of the world as a witness then the end shall come (Matthew 24:14). Christ Jesus knew that this Message of Peace would perfect this world of war.

                                        <p>Now, let’s talk Christ; today, let us get into this business of prayer, with faith, and by so doing we can indeed have peace in this hostile world. Two Holy Texts from the Scriptures shall guide us in this presentation:
                                            <br>
                                            Luke 18:1-8-  <br>
                                            <br>         And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men 
                                            <br>  ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was 
                                            <br>                                            in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded 
                                            <br>                                            man: And there was a widow in that city; and she came 
                                            <br>                                            unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he 
                                            <br>          would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, 
                                            Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this 
                                            <br>                                     widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual 
                                            coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the 
                                            unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, 
                                            <br>                                            which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with 
                                            them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. 
                                            Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he 
                                            find faith on the earth? 
                                            <br><br>
                                            And,
                                            <br>                                           Philippians 4:6, 7-
                                            Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and 
                                            <br>                                          supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made 
                                            known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth 
                                            <br>                                           all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds 
                                            through Christ Jesus. 
                                            <br>                                           I hope you didn’t find that first Text so long because it is actually quite rich; the point that Christ Jesus sought to make with that parable is really vital in this world. Like my husband has indeed mentioned before, we really live in a hostile world, a world that is plagued with chaos and strife, and all because of a very wicked and offensive adversary, satan. Consequently, it is so vital that we realize that we must live life here constantly in need of God, continually before Him, always depending on Him to secure us against the evil trials and temptations of satan and his minion of demons and men that serve him.
                                            We need God to be sure of having peace.
                                            <br><br>
                                            That point that Christ Jesus labored to make in that parable includes also the need to have faith when we pray. He knew that the reason so many people are troubled, overcome, and even oppressed by the enemy, lay in the fact that so many have given up on prayer, and have done so because they have lost their faith. In so doing, many have inadvertently opened themselves to diverse trials, and have had their affairs translated into satan’s playground. It is quite sad.
                                            <br>                                          Tragic because things don’t have to be so twisted and broken; because there really is a God that is keen on not only defending us against the attacks of satan and his dark kingdom, but who is indeed willing to fight for us and ensure our victory in any and every offense.

                                            This is what the Apostle Paul learned and shared with the church in Phillipi so that he advises them (and of course, all of us) to be anxious for nothing; but with prayers and supplications make known to God our every need with the assured guarantee that He will attend to our plight. He knew what all of us need to grasp today, that God is not only willing to help us in our trials but also that He is indeed able to. The habit of prayer with faith guarantees a life of peace.
                                            <br><br>
                                            PRAYER:
                                            <br>                                        Our Dear Father,
                                            <br>                                           Your Power in Heaven and here in the Earth is without comparison.
                                            <br>                                            No other being is as powerful as You are. And to think that You are our God, an everpresent help in time of trouble is most assuring.<br> So, I lay before You my every trial, my every trouble, and trust that You will rise me above the offenses of the kingdom of darkness.
                                            <br>                                           In You I am assured of victory; and I stand in that Victory by which Christ overcame all to be sure of being more than a conqueror in this day and always.

                                        <p>Christ Greetings Our Heavenly Family.
                                            HAPPY ETERNITY! RULE FOREVER!!!<br><br>

                                            Now, let’s talk Christ; specifically, today, let us take charge of our lives, of those we love, of this our earth, and declare- PEACE BE STILL! Let us help establish peace in the earth. 
                                            Two Holy Texts can serve to guide our sharing giving it the divine authenticity that it deserves:<br><br>

                                            Mark 4:39- 41<br>
                                            And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,<br> 
                                            Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great <br>
                                            calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is <br>
                                            it that ye have no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and <br>
                                            said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even <br>
                                            the wind and the sea obey him? <br><br>

                                            And,<br>

                                            Mat 5:9 <br> 
                                            Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the 
                                            children of God. <br><br>

                                            We live in a very hostile world that tempts us, tries our faith, that in fact, is ruled mostly by a most devious and malicious enemy that seeks to steal, kill, and destroy us; a world that is patterned in very chaotic ways intended to rob us of our peace. Beloved, get this into your heart and hold on to it as much as the Holy Spirit can allow you: You deserve to have peace, to live in peace, to be peaceful. 
                                            You do because Christ Jesus worked so hard, even at the cost of His Life, Bleeding on the Cross, to ensure that you gain peace, His Peace, Heavenly Peace; not only when you get to Heaven but right here on Earth as well.

                                            Listen to Him:<br>

                                            John 14:27  <br>
                                            Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as 
                                            the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be 
                                            troubled, neither let it be afraid. 

                                            He meant that based on the seriousness of what He accomplished for you, for all of us, on the Cross and by the Power of His Blood. There Christ Jesus secured for you, for all men, Heavenly Peace. He made His Peace our Heritage, our Eternal Heritage. You deserve Peace on that account; and should refuse to be troubled.

                                            So what do you do when our stubborn adversary, the devil, shows up seeking to disturb our peace? Rebuke him, declare with audacious command- PEACE BE STILL! 

                                            Look, Christ Jesus is the Prince of Peace; its owner, and it is for Him to give as He pleases. If He has said that He has given you peace, then it is yours. Don’t let no one, nothing, rob it from you. Any attempt at disturbing your peace places you on the legitimate right to rebuke him. Insist on your peace, fight for your peace, put the devil and his minions in their place and seize the peace that Christ Jesus gave you.

                                            Now, not everyone knows this and that is why again Christ Jesus distinguished those that do as children of God; blessed for making the peace. Yes, take charge, take your seat with Christ in Heavenly Places and declare PEACE BE STILL. Do so and see the angels work to ensure your command.

                                            <br>PEACE BE STILL!
